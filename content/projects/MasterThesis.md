TransportAR is an augmented reality app that displays nearby public transport stations, their real-time schedules, and whether they are obstructed by a building or not. This app is a part of my master's thesis project that aims to investigate the potential of augmented reality in enhancing public transportation accessibility and usability for commuters. A user study was conducted to evaluate the usability and usefulness of the app.
