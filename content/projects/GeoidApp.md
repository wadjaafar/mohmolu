GeoidApp is a software application for geoid computations, it can be used to compute the geoid height. You can also compute other type of geoid related values, like the gravity disturbance and the gravity anomaly. This is our graduation project, built it with my colleague and best friend [Mohamed Yousif](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adonese).
